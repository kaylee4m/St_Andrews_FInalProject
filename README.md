# Evidence Logging and Data Analysis for Public Engagement with Research

## Description

Public Engagement with Research (PER) team plays an important role in the University of St Andrews. It provides many opportunities for students and researchers to be engaged in valuable PER activities. At present, the researchers are able to report new activities by using the Pure system. However, Pure templates do not have a simple way to input activity details in which the PER team is interested. Thus the staff of PER team records the activity details in their own ways, mainly using spreadsheets. Moreover, the team needs a data analysis system to evaluate past work.

The aim of this study is exploring the methods to develop a data analysis system for PER activities. This thesis reports on the exploration and development process.

This project utilised two different approaches to solve the problem. One is developing a Web-based system using JavaScript. The main frameworks in the system are Vue.js and Koa.js. The other is implementing a data analysis process using Python Jupyter Notebooks. The main tools used to address the requirements in this project include MongoDB, Mongoose, adminMongo, Mongoose Node.js, ECharts, Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.

In this study, these two methods show their different capabilities and demonstrate their powerful features. The research results represent a further step towards developing the information management system. It not only finds out the shortcomings of the current data management but also provides the practical experience of data analysis.
These practices provide a robust evidence base for the further development of data analysis software for the Public Engagement with Research team.
